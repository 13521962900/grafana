# Select variants

Select is an input with the ability to search and create new values. It should be used when you have list of options. If the data has a tree structure, consider using `Cascader` instead.
Select has some features:

- Search a list of values
- Select multiple values
- Select from async data
- Create custom values that aren't in the list
